Hi Georgii

npm install to install the dependencies and npm start for starting the application

I considered express.js framework for framework. 
I used mongodb desktop  version
A takeAway Database was created and the inside collection was users

There is a control folder where all the methods for the end point hit is placed
There is a model where the schema is defined
Router calls the methods.

nodemon was used for live updating

thank you for the opportunity
